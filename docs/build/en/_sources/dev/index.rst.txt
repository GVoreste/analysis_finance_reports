The project consists in different repositories, specifically this section focus on the repository
containing the source code and the documentation.

This repository has two protected branches ``main`` and ``dev``, plus any other additional non protected branches.
The logic is that ``dev`` branch is used for the active development, ``main`` for the deployment.
On both branches each commit triggers a `CI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_ pipeline
on the `Freeport Jenkins server <https://jenkins.freeports.org>`_ this server do some checks on the code (specified in the 
``Jenkinsfile`` on top of the repository). Specifically it:

1. Lint the code
2. Fail if a minimal linting vote is reached
3. Test the code and fail if some test is not passed
4. Fail if a minimal percentage of code is not tested
5. Build the documentation
6. Fail if a minimal percentage of the code is not documented
7. If the commit is tagged as `release version` (using `semantic versioning specification <https://semver.org/>`_) it publishes it to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/freeports-analysis/>`_

The difference between the two branches is that the state of the pipeline is only informative on the ``dev`` branch 
(it means that it only shows the failing) but the positive outcome is **imposed a requirement** for the PR on ``main`` branch to be approved and merged.

In particular the development divide between:

- development of tools for helping the contribution process
- development of the code common for the different `pdf reports` 
  (for example the source code related to the options and behaviour of the ``freeports`` command)
- development of the code for parsing the different `pdf report formats`
- development of tests on the code
- writing of the documentation
- internationalization of the code (translation of messages in output of the command)
- internationalization of the documentation (translation of the documentation)
