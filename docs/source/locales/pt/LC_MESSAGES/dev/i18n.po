"This guide focus on the translation process of the documentation and of "
"the source code. The system and the conventions used by both "
"documentation and source code internationalization are the one used by "
"the `GNU gettext <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext>`_ system. In "
"particular on the root of the repository is present a file called "
"``freeports.pot`` with the updated list of the strings present in the "
"source code, and under ``docs/build/gettext`` the files with the "
"templates of documentation translatable content. Translators will mostly "
"work with ``.po`` files ready to be translated. In a second time this "
"files are compiled in a machine readable format with exstension ``.mo``. "
"So the ``.mo`` files are the one the actively contain the translation, "
"but they are generated from the ``.po`` files."
